    <h3>Loans</h3>
    <p>Definition: A loan is when money is given to another party in exchange for repayment of the loan principal amount plus interest.</p>
    <h4>Types of Loans</h4>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group item">Personal Loans – They are used for a variety of expenses and go by various names. Your credit score should at least be in the 600s</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Mortgage  – Also called a home loan, helps you finance a house, which is one of the biggest purchases of your life. They are different types of home loans such as first-time home buyers and military. The 
        higher your credit score the better outcome.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Student Loans – Helps cover the cost of a college education. Also a very big purchase in life. Credit score is not really a factor unless it is private.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Auto Loans – Helps you finance the car you want. If you don’t keep up with your payments, car will be seized. It’s no minimum but staying in the 600s will help keep your APR low.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Payday Loans – Helps cover cost of a unforeseen expense before you get your paycheck. Credit score is not a factor but short repayment periods and often triple-digit APRs, and fees will make your loan payment higher.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Pawn Shop Loans – Yield your property for short term cash that you have to pay back. If you pay the loan back on time or before schedule, you will get your property back. If you don’t pay the debt, the pawn shop will sell after a certain amount of time.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Small Business Loans – Borrow money to fund your business or maintain operation. You could also qualify whether your business is a sole proprietorship or limited liability company (LLC) in your garage or a smaller corporation. 
        Credit score needs to at least be 680 for lower rates and as low as 500s for higher rates and fees.</li>

    <h3>Grants</h3>
    <p>Definition: A grant is an award, primarily money-related, given by an organization (commonly a business, foundation, or government) to another in order to further an objective or encourage performance.</p>
    <h4>Types of Grants</h4>
    <h5>- Federal Grants</h5>
    <p>A federal grant is a financial reward made to a recipient by a federal agency to carry out a public objective of support or encouragement permitted by a United States law.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group item">Mandatory Grants - A mandatory grant is one that a federal agency must give out in accordance with the law if the grantees satisfy the eligibility and compliance standards. The award's value is often calculated by multiplying a set sum of money by a mathematical index.
         The index is typically used as a measure of need based on numerous program-specific elements as well as population and per capita income statistics. State governments and occasionally other organizations are given funds that are required.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Block Grant - Some block grants, which are sometimes seen as necessary grants to states, are made up of multiple smaller, specific-purpose awards that have been combined into a single "block." Block grants typically give recipients more freedom in how they can use the money
        they receive and come with fewer government administrative requirements.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Open-Ended Grant - A particular type of mandatory grant where the law permits the appropriation of money to cover a specific percentage of the recipient's (often state's) total costs without a cap, hence the term "open-ended."</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Close- End Grant - A form of mandatory grant that is "close-ended," meaning that the award sets a maximum amount that the federal government may spend on the activities.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">•	Discretionary Grants - Discretionary grants are awards that allow the federal government, in accordance with certain legislation, to use discretion in choosing the project or proposal to be supported and the beneficiary organization through a formal application and selection procedure. 
        The beneficiary and the grants office/program office negotiate a sum for the reward, or it is calculated using a formula. Grants with discretion are often known as "project" grants. Additionally, the Congress has the power to appropriate money for these programs on a yearly basis.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>- Student Grants</h5>
    <p>State Grant refers to money given to a recipient upon request for a particular purpose by a state spending agency, regardless of the money's originating source.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group item">First-time Home Buyers Grants - For the purpose of granting grants to qualified applicants, grants may be transferred to a local housing authority, a HUD-approved agency, or a non-profit organization. You can use the money you get to pay for the closing fees associated with your purchase, 
        get free counseling, or even pay a portion of your mortgage.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Free or Low-cost Home Repairs Grants - The Department of Housing and Urban Development also provides financial aid for house maintenance, repair, and renovation. For senior adults, low-income families, and those with disabilities, certain states provide specific resources. Community action 
        organizations are typically responsible for managing and supervising aid.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Education Grants for College Students - Student Grants relate to the funding of low-income students' college expenses. College students and those planning to return to school may be eligible to receive thousands of dollars in financial aid, depending on the state. The funds that are raised 
        can be used by a number of public and private educational institutions to cover university costs.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Jobs and Vocational Training Grants - The Workforce Investment Act, the Adult and Dislocated Worker programs, and the Youth Services program all promote and encourage specific job training programs. Every state and the federal government offer a variety of job training and education programs. 
        To find out more, get in touch with the human services organizations and community action programs in your area.</li>
        <li class="list-group item">Help Paying Bills Grants and Assistance - LIHEAP is a program from the Department of Health and Human Services that provides help with paying bills. The Commodity Supplemental Food Program is also very popular, which provides meals to both children and seniors.</li>
